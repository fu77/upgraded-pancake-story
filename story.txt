Kijin Seija is an Amanojaku in Gensokyo, just like Seija Kijin. He can turn over everything that was turned over by Seija Kijin. With this being said, Kijin seems to be a much likable creature than Seija Kijin. But actually, being an Amanojaku means that he also has a twisted soul. The only difference between him and Seija is the effect of their ability. Seija enjoys flipping everything, while Kijin enjoys reversing everything, not for righteousness, just for fun. Therefore, although he always fixes problems caused by Seija, his presence seems not to be appreciated by the villagers.
