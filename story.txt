Kijin Seija is an Amanojaku in Gensokyo, just like Seija Kijin. He can turn over everything that was turned over by Seija Kijin. With this being said, Kijin seems to be a much likable creature than Seija Kijin. But actually, being an Amanojaku means that he also has a twisted soul. The only difference between him and Seija is the effect of their ability. Seija enjoys flipping everything, while Kijin enjoys reversing everything, not for righteousness, just for fun. Therefore, although he always fixes problems caused by Seija, his presence seems not to be appreciated by the villagers.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Kijin was just trying to enjoy his ice cream when something out of the ordinary happened: It seemed that Seija was up t o to no good, turning all of the chocolate ice cream in the village into vanilla. Kijin hated vanilla! He vowed that he would have all of the delicious chocolate back and restored to the poor villagers in no time... There were already children crying over their new ice cream. The horror!

In fact, although Kijin and Seija and Seija Kigin always appear to fight against each other, Kijin Seija and Seija Kijin secretly loves each other. Just because their families are rivalries, they are not allowed to be friendly to each other.
